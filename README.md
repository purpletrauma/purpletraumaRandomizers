# purpletraumaRandomizers

Just a bunch of nonsense randomizers I coded idly to both use, and as a practice project.

Most of the work as of the first commit is mine, and I don't see having anyone else get too involved, beyond maybe recommendations for more words to add to arrays.

A few of the arrays are filled with quotes from various sources, and the shuffle function for the arrays is copied from an example of a common algorithm posted in response to someone else asking how to do that.

Essentially all this project is; I just wanted to share it around some more.

(seeing if this pushes to main repo)
