- Got the randomizers working with angularJS, cutting code used in half.
- textCode.js removed as it was no longer referenced.
- More odds and ends of items added to randomizers.
- Extensive re-programming in general.
- Hours of sifting through other's question answers to get it all working.
- Why is the standard of, if something doesn't work, you create an extensive series of nested loops and functions, rather than find a way to do it more easily?
- It shouldn't have taken me hours to find out that $scope is write only, and I should've been passing variables into the function.
- Instead, everyone had some series of 10 to 50 lines of code that just made it work directly and usually inserted the desired variable into another function.
- Stackoverflow is more frustrating than helpful.
- So damn tired. Just sorta zoned out and kept working on it all last night.
